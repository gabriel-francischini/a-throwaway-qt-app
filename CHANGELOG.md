## [Unreleased]
### Summary
- **Is release backwards compatible?** Yes, because there was none 
releases before this one. You should expect things to just work.
- **Should I upgrade immediately?** No, upgrade is neither recommended
nor required.

### What are the new features?
- There's a new UI.
  **Why?** We decided that any UI was better than none, so here it is.
  **How can I use this new stuff?** If you launch the `app.exe` 
  (or `./app` if you're in a UNIX-like system) you should see the new UI. 
  If the program don't launches, please
